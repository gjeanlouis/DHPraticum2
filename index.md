# In Class Exercise
## Student's name: Gabrielle Jean-Louis

The exercise was not too challenging because I prepared myself. I am feeling more confident in my use of digital tools compared to Week 1!

## Comments or notes about problems 

It really helped that I took the time to practice and review over the week. I was able to confidently write my html file using markdown much faster than when we first learned this skill. I do wish my French Toast receipe page looked prettier, I had trouble getting the image to sit in the middle. I also wanted all of the words to be in white but for some reason I could not get the font to change and I did not want to mess it up. Overall, I am very proud of myself and the class! It was so nice to see everyone focused and figuring everything out on their own.
